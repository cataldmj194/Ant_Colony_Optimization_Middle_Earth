ACO.java is my implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for this assignment.

MidEarthVertex.java are vertex objects used to contain middle earth node info.

MidEarthEdge.java are edge objects used to contain node to node info.

Ant.java are ant objects used to contain an ant's information.

Atlas.txt is my file for parsing which contains all of the node/edge info
from the assignment description.

Usage: 
for compilation, issue either of the following commands
javac ACO.java Ant.java MidEarthVertex.java MidEarthEdge.java

-or-

javac *.java

run the program in the following format:

java ACO.java <NameOfTextFile>

Resulting data from my runs is in the results directory
